# genetic_algorithm
This is a project to optimise the number of collection points and minimise the distance covered by a mobile sink during big data gathering. This is achieved by genetic algorithm approach.
Genetic algorithm mainly employs tools such as cross over, mutation and fitness to optimise the result.
We compare our results with another approach known as the EM algortihm approach, which employs the concept of centroid for a set of collection points. 
The results obtained suggest that although EM approach gives more coverage, genetic algorithm is more efficient if distance travelled by the mobile sink is considered.
