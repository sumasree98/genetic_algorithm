# genetic_algorithm
This is a project to optimise the number of collection points and minimise the distance covered by a mobile sink during big data gathering. This is achieved by genetic algorithm approach.
We compare our results with another approach known as the EM algortihm approach. 
The results obtained suggest that although EM approach gives more coverage, genetic algorithm is more efficient if distance travelled by the mobile sink is considered.
